# MidiChordSplitter
.NET application to split out chords into separate notes and channels

## Background
I created this to help with converting MIDI into FamiStudio projects. FamiStudio, by default, drops notes when there is a chord and splitting this way allows to retain more of the music information to better decide how to arrange the MIDI as a chiptune.

## Usage
This is a simple .NET 8.0 Console/Terminal application with input and output switches -i InputFileName and -o OutputFileName
